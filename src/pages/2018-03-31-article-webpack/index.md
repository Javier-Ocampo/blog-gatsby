# Webpack 4

There are a million tutorials online, so you probably have seen a thousand different ways to configure Webpack file. And all of them will be working examples. Why is it so? Webpack itself has been evolving really fast and a lot of loaders and plugins have to keep up. This is a major reason why the configuration files are so different: with a different version combination of the same tools things might work, or break.

Let me just say one thing, and this is my sincere opinion: a lot of people have been complaining about webpack and how cumbersome it is. This is true in many ways, although I have to say with my experience of working with gulp and grunt, you stumble upon the same type of errors there too, meaning that when you use npm modules, itâ€™s inevitable that some versions would be incompatible.

Webpack 4 so far is the popular module bundler that has just undergone a massive update. There is a lot of new things it has to offer, such as zero configuration, reasonable defaults, performance improvement, optimisation tools out of the box.
